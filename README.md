Tracker-IoT
===========

This is a fork of [Tracker](http://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Tracker) for the Semantic Web of Things.
It includes simplified versions of the [Semantic Sensors Network](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/ssn/ssnx/ssn) and related ontologies.

Most of the added ontologies are extracted from the n3 versions available on the [Linked Open Vocabularies](http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/) site.
